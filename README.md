# air-quality
We want to use the layers of Keras to process our data of air quality 
In this GitHub repository, our focus is on preparing the data for analysis. We begin by normalizing the data to ensure consistency and eliminate any variations in scale. This step is crucial for enhancing the performance of our machine learning models.

After data normalization, we proceed to address the presence of outliers. Outliers can adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our analysis, so we implement techniques to identify and remove them. By eliminating outliers, we aim to create a more robust and representative dataset for training our models.

Once the data is properly prepared, we move on to the core of our workâ€”building and training our machine learning model. We leverage neural networks as the foundation for our model and fine-tune it using appropriate loss functions to minimize errors and improve accuracy. By optimizing these parameters, we aim to achieve the best possible performance from our neural network model.

To assess the effectiveness of our neural network, we compare its performance with other machine learning algorithms. This comparative analysis allows us to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and determine which algorithm yields the most accurate predictions for our specific dataset.

Through this repository, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation in machine learning. By following these steps, researchers and practitioners can gain insights into the effectiveness of various algorithms and make informed decisions when working with their own datasets.
